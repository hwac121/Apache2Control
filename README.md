# Apache2Control
This is a simple apache2 control script to save a little typing for Parrot Security OS users.
I made this for my own laziness and I hope others find it handy also. Enjoy!

NOTE: ONLY tested on Parrot Security OS v4.6

INSTALLATION
After cloing or grabbing source be sure to make all bash files executable before running the installer.
PLEASE NOTE - THIS THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE - Use as you wish, modify as you wish, all I ask is credit as the original author.
